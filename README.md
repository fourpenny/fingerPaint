# fingerPaint
This a basic fingerpainting Python app using a webcam, utilizing the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries. Use your pointer finger to paint the screen in a rainbow of colors!

You can change these colors in the code by adding or subtracting to the "basicColors" list. You can also change the gradient to be longer/shorter by changing the stepsBtwn in the getColorValues function.

Note: OpenCV uses BGR colors by default.

## While using the program:
Press 'q' when launched to quit, give a high-five or press 'c' to clear the screen.
